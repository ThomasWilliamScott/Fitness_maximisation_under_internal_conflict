# Fitness_maximisation_under_internal_conflict
This repository contains draft code for ongoing work on whether fitness is maximised under internal conflict.

The 'Run_single_trial.m' script runs the model for one single set of parameter values. The 'Run_multiple_trials.m' script runs the model for a sweep across parameter values. Both of these scripts work by calling the 'Generate_data.m' script, which generates the data. Some multi-trial data is saved in the 'results.mat' file.
